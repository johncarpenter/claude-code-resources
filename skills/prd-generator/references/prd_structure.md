## PRD Writing Tips

- **Be concise but complete**: Aim for 5-15 pages for most features
- **Use visual aids**: Include diagrams, flowcharts, and mockups
- **Keep it living**: Update the PRD as decisions evolve
- **Link, don't duplicate**: Reference other documents rather than copying content
- **Focus on the "why"**: Don't just describe what to build, explain why
- **Make it scannable**: Use clear headers, bullet points, and formatting
- **Define success early**: Establish metrics before building
- **Collaborate**: Get input from engineering, design, and stakeholders
